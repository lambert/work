      <para>The octave filter is to separate a pre-amplified signal into 10
      frequency bands.</para>

      <para>This is done by using band pass filter and detector
      modules.</para>

      <para>The modules are paired on a pcb, which is plugged into a socket
      (female header).</para>

    <title>Operational amplifiers.</title>

    <section>
      <title>Operational Amplifier basics.</title>

      <para>Operational amplifiers are one of the workhorses of the analogue
      electronics scene.</para>

      <para>Op-amps, as they are also known are widely available in the form
      of integrated circuits, many costing only a few cents or a few pence for
      the standard versions.</para>

      <para>High performance op amp integrated circuits still offer excellent
      value for money, but obviously cost a little more. In view of their ease
      of use and low cost, these integrated circuits are used in vast
      quantities enabling high performance electronics circuits to be
      developed and designed with a minimum of electronics components.</para>

      <para>Operational amplifiers, op amps are virtually the ideal
      amplifier.</para>

      <para>They provide a combination of parameters that are of great
      use:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Very high gain</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Very high input impedance</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Very low output impedance</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The operational amplifier is what is known as a differential
      amplifier.</para>

      <para>The differential amplifier has two inputs and this enables it to
      be used in a wide number of circuit configurations.</para>

      <para>The circuit symbol for an operational amplifier consists simply of
      a triangle as shown below.</para>

      <para>The two inputs are designated by "+" and "-" symbols, and the
      output of the operational amplifier is at the opposite end of the
      triangle.</para>

      <para>Inputs from the "+" input appear at the output in the same phase,
      whereas signals present at the "-" input appear at the output inverted
      or 180 degrees out of phase.</para>

      <para>This gives rise to the names for the inputs.</para>

      <para>The "+" input is known as the non-inverting input, while the "-"
      input is the inverting input of the operational amplifier.</para>

      <para>As the output from the amplifier is dependent upon the difference
      in voltage between the two inputs, it is known as a differential
      amplifier.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Op amp circuit symbol.</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="pics/op-amp_circuit_symbol.gif"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Often the power supply rails for the operational amplifier are not
      shown in circuit diagrams and there is no connection for a ground
      line.</para>

      <para>The power rails for the operational amplifier are assumed to be
      connected.</para>

      <para>The power for the operational amplifier is generally supplied as a
      positive rail and also a negative rail.</para>

      <para>Often voltages of +15V and -15 V are used, although this will vary
      according to the application and the actual chip used.</para>

      <para>The gain of the operational amplifier is very high.</para>

      <para>Figures for the levels of gain provided by an operational
      amplifier on its own are very high.</para>

      <para>Typically they may be upwards of 10 000.</para>

      <para>While levels of gain may be too high for use on their own, the
      application of feedback around the operational amplifier enables the
      circuit to be used in a wide variety of applications, from very flat
      amplifiers, to filters, oscillators, switches, and much more.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Op-amp open loop gain.</title>

        <para>The gain of an operational amplifier is exceedingly high.</para>

        <para>Normally feedback is applied around the op-amp so that the gain
        of the overall circuit is defined and kept to a figure which is more
        usable.</para>

        <para>However the very high level of gain of the op-amp enables
        considerable levels of feedback to be applied to enable the required
        performance to be achieved.</para>

        <para>When measured the open loop gain of an operational amplifier
        falls very rapidly with increasing frequency.</para>

        <para>Typically an op-amp may have an open loop gain of around 100
        000, but this usually starts to fall very quickly.</para>

        <para>For the famous 741 operational amplifier, it starts to fall at a
        frequency of only 10 Hz.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Op-amp slew rate.</title>

        <para>With very high gains the operational amplifiers have what is
        termed compensation capacitance to prevent oscillation.</para>

        <para>This capacitance combined with the limited drive currents mean
        that the output of the amplifier is only able to change at a limited
        rate, even when a large or rapid change occurs at the input.</para>

        <para>This maximum speed is known as the slew rate.</para>

        <para>A typical general purpose device may have a slew rate of 10 V /
        microsecond.</para>

        <para>This means that when a large step change is placed on the input,
        the device would be able to provide an output 10 volt change in one
        microsecond.</para>

        <para>The figures for slew rate change are dependent upon the type of
        operational amplifier being used.</para>

        <para>Low power op-amps may only have a slew rate of a volt per
        microsecond, whereas there are fast operational amplifiers capable to
        providing slew rates of 1000 V / microsecond.</para>

        <para>The slew rate can introduce distortion onto a signal by limiting
        the frequency of a large signal that can be accommodated.</para>

        <para>It is possible to find the maximum frequency or voltage that can
        be accommodated.</para>

        <para>A sine wave with a frequency of f Hertz and amplitude V volts
        requires an operational amplifier with a slew rate of 2 x pi x V x V
        volts per second.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Offset null.</title>

        <para>One of the minor problems with an operational amplifier is that
        they have a small offset.</para>

        <para>Normally this is small, but it is quoted in the datasheets for
        the particular operational amplifier in question.</para>

        <para>It is possible to null this using an external potentiometer
        connected to the three offset null pins.</para>

        <para>In most applications no provision is made for the offset
        null.</para>

        <para>This is because it is normally not a problem and it adds further
        components and an adjustment.</para>

        <para>However it can be a problem where large levels of DC gain are
        required.</para>

        <para>Here the offset voltage is amplified by the gain and could
        appear as a significant voltage at the output.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Op-amp circuits.</title>

        <para>There is a huge variety of electronics circuits that can be
        designed using operational amplifiers.</para>

        <para>These opamp circuits range from amplifiers to multivibrators,
        integrators to comparators and oscillators to timers.</para>

        <para>It shows how versatile these op-amp integrated circuits
        are.</para>

        <para>All these different circuits tend to use the high input
        impedance, low output impedance and high gain of the op-amp, combined
        with the fact that the operational amplifier is a differential
        amplifier.</para>

        <para>In most circuits, feedback (usually negative feedback) is placed
        around the op-amp and the way this is done provides the required
        function.</para>

        <para>Only in very few applications is no feedback applied.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Operational amplifier packages.</title>

        <para>The packages in which electronics components are available is
        very important.</para>

        <para>Many electronics components are available in a wide variety of
        package styles, and the operational amplifier is not exception.</para>

        <para>Like many other electronics components, a vast number are used
        as surface mount components in mass produced electronics
        products.</para>

        <para>They are available in the SOIC (small outline integrated
        circuit) package as well as many others.</para>

        <para>Some are even available in five leaded versions of transistor
        packages and this makes them ideal to drop into a circuit without
        using up much board space.</para>

        <para>However the more traditional style of electronics component
        packages are also available.</para>

        <para>They are available in the DIL (dual in line) package, often as a
        single operational amplifier in an eight pin DIL, or duals in eight
        pin packages (with no offset null connections) or fourteen or sixteen
        pin DILs.</para>

        <para>Operational amplifiers are in widespread use in analogue
        electronics design and production.</para>

        <para>These op amps provide a particularly useful combination of
        circuit parameters that make them an indispensable tool for the
        electronics design engineer.</para>

        <para>While digital electronics is growing, the use of op-amps will
        nevertheless remain in vast quantities as a result of their cost,
        performance and ease of use.</para>

        <para>These electronics components will therefore remain very cheap
        for many years to come.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Operational Amplifier Gain</title>

      <para>The gain of an operational amplifier or op-amp (opamp) circuit
      depends upon a variety of factors including the circuit configuration as
      well as the components around the operational amplifier chip
      itself.</para>

      <para>This section gives a summary or overview of the gain of the
      different operational amplifier circuits available.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Inverting op-amp gain.</title>

        <para>The circuit for the inverting op-amp circuit is shown
        below.</para>

        <para>This circuit has the output 180 degrees out of phase with the
        input and also provides a virtual earth input.</para>

        <figure>
          <title>Basic inverting operational amplifier circuit.</title>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="pics/op-amp_basic_inv.gif" width="250"/>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>It is easy to derive the calculation for the op-amp gain.</para>

        <para>The input to the op-amp itself draws no current and this means
        that the current flowing in the resistors R1 and R2 is the
        same.</para>

        <para>Using ohms law Vout /R2 = -Vin/R1.</para>

        <para>Hence the voltage gain of the circuit Av can be taken as:</para>

        <para>Av = - R2 / R1</para>

        <para>As an example, an amplifier requiring a gain of ten could be
        built by making R2 = 47 k ohms and R1 = 4.7 k ohms.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Non-Inverting Op-Amp gain.</title>

        <para>The circuit for the non-inverting op-amp is shown below.</para>

        <para>It offers a higher input impedance than the inverting opamp
        circuit.</para>

        <figure>
          <title>Basic non-inverting operational amplifier circuit.</title>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="pics/op-amp_basic_non_inv.gif" width="250"/>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>The gain of the non-inverting circuit for the operational
        amplifier is easy to determine.</para>

        <para>The calculation hinges around the fact that the voltage at both
        inputs is the same.</para>

        <para>This arises from the fact that the gain of the amplifier is
        exceedingly high. If the output of the circuit remains within the
        supply rails of the amplifier, then the output voltage divided by the
        gain means that there is virtually no difference between the two
        inputs.</para>

        <para>As the input to the op-amp draws no current this means that the

        <para>The voltage at the inverting input is formed from a potential

      <title>Inverting operational amplifier.</title>

      <para>Operational amplifiers can be used in a wide variety of circuit
      configurations.</para>

      <para>One of the most widely used is the inverting amplifier
      configuration.</para>

      <para>It offers many advantages from being very simple to use, requiring
      just the operational amplifier integrated circuit and a few other
      components.</para>

      <para>Circuits are available for an inverting amplifier, and a
      non-inverting amplifier.</para>

      <para>This version details the inverting amplifier, where the output is
      the mirror image of the input.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Basic inverting circuit.</title>

        <para>The basic circuit for the inverting operational amplifier
        circuit is shown below.</para>

        <para>It consists of a resistor from the input terminal to the
        inverting input of the circuit, and another resistor connected from
        the output to the inverting input of the op-amp.</para>

        <para>The non inverting input is connected to ground.</para>

        </figure>

        <para>In this circuit the non inverting input of the operational
        amplifier is connected to ground.</para>

        <para>As the gain of the operational amplifier itself is very very
        high and the output from the amplifier is a matter of a few volts,
        this means that the difference between the two input terminals is
        exceedingly small and can be ignored.</para>

        <para>As the non-inverting input of the operational amplifier is held
        at ground potential this means that the inverting input must be
        virtually at earth potential (i.e. a virtual earth).</para>

        <para>As the input to the op-amp itself draws no virtually current
        this means that the current flowing in the resistors R1 and R2 is the
        same.</para>

        <para>Using Ohms law: Vout /R2 = -Vin/R1.</para>

        <para>Hence the voltage gain of the circuit Av can be taken as:</para>

        <para>Av = - R2 / R1</para>

        <para>As an example, an amplifier requiring a gain of ten could be
        built by making R2 = 47 k ohms and R1 = 4.7 k ohms.</para>

        <para>Reminder:</para>

        <para>It is worth mentioning at this point that for high levels of
        gain, the gain bandwidth product of the basic op amp itself may become
        a problem.</para>

        <para>With levels of gain of 100, the bandwidth of some operational
        amplifier ICs may only be around 3 kHz.</para>

        settling on the level of gain.</para>

      <para>Operational amplifiers can be used in two basic configurations to

      <para>One is the inverting amplifier where the output is the inverse or
      180 degrees out of phase with the input, and the other is the
      non-inverting amplifier where the output is in the same sense or in
      phase with the input.</para>

      <para>Both operational amplifier circuits are widely used and they find
      applications in different areas.</para>

        <para>However the feedback is taken from the output of the op-amp via
        a resistor to the inverting input of the operational amplifier where
        another resistor is taken to ground.</para>

        <para>The gain of the non-inverting circuit for the operational

        <para>The calculation hinges around the fact that the voltage at both

        <para>This arises from the fact that the gain of the amplifier is
        exceedingly high.</para>

        <para>If the output of the circuit remains within the supply rails of
        the amplifier, then the output voltage divided by the gain means that
        there is virtually no difference between the two inputs.</para>

        <para>As the input to the op-amp draws no current this means that the
        current flowing in the resistors R1 and R2 is the same.</para>

        <para>The voltage at the inverting input is formed from a potential

        <para>Typically they should be 1% or better.</para>

        <para>A notch depth of 45 dB can be obtained using 1% components,

        <para>R1 and R2 should be matched to within 0.5% or they may be
        trimmed using parallel resistors.</para>

        <para>A further item to ensure the optimum operation of the circuit is

        <title>Op amp twin T notch filter circuit with variable Q.</title>

        <para>The twin T notch filter with variable Q is a simple circuit that
        can provide a good level of rejection at the "notch" frequency.</para>

        <para>It uses two operational amplifiers in the circuit, and the twin
        "T" section can be seen between the two operational amplifiers.</para>

        <para>The variable Q function for the twin T notch filter is provided
        by the potentiometer placed on the non-inverting input of the lower
        operational amplifier in the diagram.</para>

        <para>Calculation of the value for the circuit is very
        straightforward.</para>

        <para>The formula is the same as that used for the passive version of
        the twin T notch filter.</para>

        <para>fc = 1 / (2 pi R C)</para>

        <para>Where:</para>

        <para>fc = cut off frequency in Hertz</para>

        <para>pi = 3.142</para>

        <para>R and C are the values of the resistors and capacitors as in the
        circuit</para>

        <para>The notch filter circuit can be very useful, and the adjustment
        facility for the Q can also be very handy.</para>

        <para>The main drawback of the notch filter circuit is that as the
        level of Q is increased, the depth of the null reduces.</para>

        <para>Despite this the notch filter circuit can be successfully
        incorporated into many circuit applications.</para>

        <para>The two op amp notch filter circuits are very easy to use and
        provide a good level of performance without being excessively
        complicated.</para>

        <para>They are a useful tool in the armoury of the analogue

      <title>Operational amplifier multivibrator oscillator.</title>

      <para>Multivibrator oscillators are used in many electronics circuits
      and they are simple to construct.</para>

      <para>It is possible to construct them using a couple of transistors,
      but it is also possible to construct a very simple multivibrator
      oscillator circuit using an operational amplifier.</para>

      <para>The circuit can be used in a variety of applications where a
      simple square wave oscillator circuit is required.</para>

      <para>The use of an operational amplifier integrated circuit is ideal
      from many viewpoints.</para>

      <para>Although circuits can be made using just two transistors,
      operational amplifiers are also very cheap these days, and there is
      often little to choose in terms of cost.</para>

        <para>T = 2 C R1 loge (1 + 2 R2 / R3)</para>

        <para>Although many multivibrator circuits may be provided using
        simple logic gates, this operational amplifier multivibrator circuit
        has the advantage that it can be used to provide an oscillator that
        will generate a much higher output than that which could come from a
        logic circuit running from a 5 volt supply.</para>

        <para>In addition to this the multivibrator oscillator circuit is very
        simple, requiring just one operational amplifier, op amp, three
        resistors, and a single capacitor.</para>

      <title>Operational amplifier bistable multivibrator.</title>

      <para>It is easy to use an operational amplifier as a bistable
      multivibrator.</para>

      <para>An incoming waveform is converted into short pulses and these are
      used to trigger the operational amplifier to change between its two
      saturation states.</para>

      <para>To prevent small levels of noise triggering the circuit,
      hysteresis is introduced into the circuit, the level being dependent
      upon the application required.</para>

      <para>The operational amplifier bistable multivibrator uses just five
      components, the operational amplifier, a capacitor and three
      resistors.</para>

      operational amplifier operating with the given supply voltages.</para>

      <para>The circuit can then be switched between them by applying
      pulses.</para>

      <para>A negative going pulse will switch the circuit into the positive
      saturation voltage, and a positive going pulse will switch it into the
      negative state.</para>

      <para>It is very easy to calculate the points at which the circuit will

      the potential divider, i.e. Vo-Sat x R3 / (R2 + R3), and similarly the

      <title>Operational amplifier comparator.</title>

      <para>Comparator circuits find a number of applications in
      electronics.</para>

      <para>As the name implies they are used to compare two voltages.</para>

      <para>When one is higher than the other the comparator circuit output is
      in one state, and when the input conditions are reversed, then the
      comparator output switches.</para>

      <para>These circuits find many uses as detectors.</para>

      <para>They are often used to sense voltages.</para>

      <para>For example they could have a reference voltage on one input, and
      a voltage that is being detected on another.</para>

      <para>While the detected voltage is above the reference the output of
      the comparator will be in one state.</para>

      <para>If the detected voltage falls below the reference then it will
      change the state of the comparator, and this could be used to flag the
      condition.</para>

      <para>This is but one example of many for which comparators can be used.
      In operation the op amp goes into positive or negative saturation
      dependent upon the input voltages.</para>

      <para>As the gain of the operational amplifier will generally exceed 100
      000 the output will run into saturation when the inputs are only
      fractions of a millivolt apart.</para>

      <para>Although op amps are widely used as comparator, special comparator
      chips are often used.</para>

      <para>These integrated circuits offer very fast switching times, well
      above those offered by most op-amps that are intended for more linear
      applications.</para>

      <para>Typical slew rates are in the region of several thousand volts per
      microsecond, although more often figures of propagation delay are
      quoted.</para>

      <para>A typical comparator circuit will have one of the inputs held at a
      given voltage.</para>

      <para>This may often be a potential divider from a supply or reference
      source.</para>

      <para>The other input is taken to the point to be sensed.</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>There are a number of points to remember when using comparator
      circuits.</para>

      <para>As there is no feedback the two inputs to the circuit will be at
      different voltages.</para>

      <para>Accordingly it is necessary to ensure that the maximum
      differential input is not exceeded.</para>

      <para>Again as a result of the lack of feedback the load will
      change.</para>

      <para>Particularly as the circuit changes there will be a small increase
      in the input current.</para>

      <para>For most circuits this will not be a problem, but if the source
      impedance is high it may lead to a few unusual responses.</para>

      <para>The main problem with this circuit is that new the changeover
      point, even small amounts of noise will cause the output to switch back
      and forth.</para>

      <para>Thus near the changeover point there may be several transitions at
      the output and this may give rise to problems elsewhere in the overall
      circuit.</para>

      <para>The solution to this is to use a Schmitt Trigger as described on
      another page.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Operational amplifier Schmitt trigger.</title>

      <para>Although the simple comparator circuit using either an ordinary
      operational amplifier (op-amp) or a special comparator chip is often
      adequate, if the input waveform is slow or has noise on it, then there
      is the possibility that the output will switch back and forth several
      times during the switch over phase as only small levels of noise on the
      input will cause the output to change.</para>

      <para>This may not be a problem in some circumstances, but if the output
      from the operational amplifier comparator is being fed into fast logic
      circuitry, then it can often give rise to problems.</para>

      <para>The problem can be solved very easily by adding some positive
      feedback to the operational amplifier or comparator circuit.</para>

      <para>This is provided by the addition of R3 in the circuit below and
      the circuit is known as a Schmitt trigger.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Operational amplifier Schmitt trigger circuit.</title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The effect of the new resistor (R3) is to give the circuit
      different switching thresholds dependent upon the output state of the
      comparator or operational amplifier.</para>

      <para>When the output of the comparator is high, this voltage is fed
      back to the non-inverting input of the operational amplifier of
      comparator.</para>

      <para>As a result the switching threshold becomes higher.</para>

      <para>When the output is switched in the opposite sense, the switching
      threshold is lowered.</para>

      <para>This gives the circuit what is termed hysteresis.</para>

      <para>The fact that the positive feedback applied within the circuit
      ensures that there is effectively a higher gain and hence the switching
      is faster.</para>

      <para>This is particularly useful when the input waveform may be
      slow.</para>

      <para>However a speed up capacitor can be applied within the Schmitt
      trigger circuit to increase the switching speed still further.</para>

      <para>By placing a capacitor across the positive feedback resistor R3,
      the gain can be increased during the changeover, making the switching
      even faster.</para>

      <para>This capacitor , known as a speed up capacitor may be anywhere
      between 10 and 100 pF dependent upon the circuit.</para>

      <para>It is quite easy to calculate the resistors needed in the Schmitt
      trigger circuit.</para>

      <para>The centre voltage about which the circuit should switch is
      determined by the potential divider chain consisting of R1 and
      R2.</para>

      <para>This should be chosen first.</para>

      <para>Then the feedback resistor R3 can be calculated.</para>

      <para>This will provide a level of hysteresis that is equal to the
      output swing of the circuit reduced by the potential divide formed as a
      result of R3 and the parallel combination of R1 and R2.</para>
